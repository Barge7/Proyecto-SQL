## Introduction

The Vikings and the Saxons are at War. Both are Soldiers but they have their own methods to fight. Vikings are ported to Python. YAY!!

In this laboratory you will work with the concept of inheritance in Python.

### Getting Started

You will find the following files in the folder of this laboratory:

- `vikingsClasses.py`
- `1-testSoldier.py`
- `2-testVikings.py`
- `3-testSaxons.py`
- `4-testWar.py`

You are free to use any of the code editors you have to open these files.

### Challenge Question

Modify the file `vikingsClasses.py` so that all the tests are correct.

## Submission

- Modify `vikingsClasses.py` and save your changes.

## Tests

Best way to know how our code is doing is to work with tests. You will test the `vikingsClases.py` file step by step. 

You will **only** be **editing** the vikingsClasses.py. The files you will **running** to test your code are the following: 1-testsSoldier.py, 2-testsVikings.py, 3-testsSaxons.py & 4-testsWar.py, depending on how far you have written your code. 

So, let's say you have already created the class for Soldiers.

1. You wrote your code
2. Make sure you save the changes in your editor
3. In your terminal, run the test file for that class

```bash
$ python3 1-testSoldier.py --v
